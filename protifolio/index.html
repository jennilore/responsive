                    a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
                    Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability 
                    with the use of significant indentation.
                    Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. 
                    It supports multiple programming paradigms, including 
                    structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented 
                    and functional programming. It is often described as a 
                    "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

                    The General Electric GE90 is a family 
                    of high-bypass turbofan aircraft engines 
                    built by GE Aerospace for the Boeing 777, 
                    with thrust ratings from 81,000 to 115,000 
                    pounds-force (340 to 510 kilonewtons). 
                    It entered service with British Airways 
                    in November 1995. It is one of three options 
                    for the 777-200, -200ER, and -300 versions, and 
                    the exclusive engine of the -200LR, -300ER, and 777F.  
                    It was the largest jet engine, until being surpassed 
                    in January 2020 by its successor, the 110,000 lbf 
                    (490 kN) GE9X, which has a larger fan diameter by 6
                    inches (15 cm).

                    A midget submarine is any submarine under 150 tons,
                    typically operated by a crew of one or two but 
                    sometimes up to six or nine, with little or no on-board 
                    living accommodation. They normally work with mother ships, 
                    from which they are launched and recovered and which 
                    provide living accommodation for the crew and support staff.
                    Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company built the 
                    mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer 
                    tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.
